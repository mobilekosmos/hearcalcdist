# Hearing Disability Calculator

A comprehensive web application and progressive web app for calculating hearing disability percentages and generating audiograms based on pure-tone air conduction audiometry threshold values. ENT specialists usually needs to calculate this manually for each patient. Also each country may have different laws, rules and formulas how to calculate this, so the investigation and requirements specifications, and also making sure the texts are correct actually were equally or more work than the coding itself. The idea is to not just offer a modern calculator to the Drs., but also offer important relevant informations to the topic, that's why I added many tooltips, despite professionals may know this already from the top of their heads. This app could be extended to add support to more countries, and also add more educational content since hearing loss is a serious issue, but in a lot of cases it can be prevented if people would be aware of the causes like listening to loud music for prolonged period of times, etc.
